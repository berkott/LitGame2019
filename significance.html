            Elsinore's Palace of Games was developed to show the theme of ones 
            own mortality. This is illustrated in all of the games since 
            eventually, the player dies in all of them. There is an end to 
            all of the games just like there is to any life on earth. This is 
            seen throughout the entire play as Hamlet questions his mortality 
            and the purpose of his existence. He most directly addresses this 
            concern during his infamous To be or not to be soloiquy where he 
            says, "To die, to sleep-To sleep, perchance to dream. Ay there's the 
            rub," (3.1.72-73). Here Hamlet expressed his fear of the unknown 
            in death when he says, "Ay there's the rub," and also expresses his 
            thoughts about killing himself when he says "To die, to sleep." 
            Overall, the theme of mortality is seen throughout the whole novel 
            where Hamlet constantly questions his mortality through thoughts of 
            suicide. Other characters such as Hamlet's ghost father and Claudius 
            also show the significance of mortality in the play by killing and 
            seaking power.
